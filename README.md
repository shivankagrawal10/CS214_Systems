# Testing Strategy #

In order to test our project, we came up with a variety of test cases encompassing the expected functions of the project. In order to test the functionality of Part 1 of the project, we created a wide variety of text files. We included files that contained multiple paragraphs/paragraph breaks and new lines. We also included files that contained long individual words so as to test the functionality of the program's failure function. We also tested edge/corner cases to make sure our program was robust.
