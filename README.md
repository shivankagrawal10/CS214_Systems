# Testing Strategy #

In order to test our project, we came up with a variety of test cases encompassing the expected functions of the project. In order to test the functionality of Part 1 of the project, we created a wide variety of text files. We included files that contained multiple paragraphs/paragraph breaks and new lines. We also included files that contained long individual words so as to test the functionality/peformance of the program's failure function. We also ran the program on files which contained multiple spaces between individual words and also on files that contained significant amounts of white spaces and new line characters before the first word.  

   In order to test the functionality of Part 2, we created directories within the directory that our project files/program were in. We then placed the aforementioned files in that particular directory. We also made sure to create and place several other directories within those aforementioned directories.We also tested edge/corner cases to make sure our program was robust.
